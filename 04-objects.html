			/*An object groups multiple values together.
            objects make our code more organised.
            objects lets us use multiple properties together.
            
            property-value pair.
            we use dot notation to access a value of an object.
            we can also use the dot nation to add values to the object.

            to delete a property from an object we use delete key word.

            object is just but another type of value. we can save it in a variable.
